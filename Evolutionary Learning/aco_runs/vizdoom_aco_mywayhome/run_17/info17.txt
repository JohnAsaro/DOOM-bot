Note:
Same as run 15 except we pick up at 115 of run 15,
fixed logging so it stops logging incorrectly when the kernel crashes (which it might here because it has to run for like 2 days)
And we change the beta logic to instead of boosting each move by a percentage 1 + boost_value, we do 0 + boost_value, 
its more like an adjustment now so we call them adjustments instead of boosting.

Result: Never finished generating this one because I am pretty sure this is going nowhere,
and also the kernel crashed.
