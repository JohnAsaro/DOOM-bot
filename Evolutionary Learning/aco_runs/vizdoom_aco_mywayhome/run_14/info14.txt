env = mywayhome_VZG(config_path=doomfinder("my_way_home_4_dir.cfg"), pheromone_evaporation_rate=0.00003968253, render=False, frameskip=4) #Lower frameskip makes better maps but takes longer
aco_training(env, num_ants = 10, iterations=200, pheromone_deposit = 8.0, run_dir=run_dir, log_dir=log_dir, maps_dir=maps_dir, alpha = 0.7, beta = 0.3) #Run ACO training

# Game variables that will be in the state
available_game_variables = { POSITION_X POSITION_Y ANGLE VELOCITY_X VELOCITY_Y } 

Same as run 12 except with a quarter of the pheromone evaporation rate.

RESULTS:

Total spawn counts and success rates at iteration 199/200
Total spawned far: 19/348 -> 5.45977011494%
Total spawned relatively close: 41/413 -> 9.92736077482%
Total spawned close: 91/1239 -> 7.34463276836%

Doesnt seem to do significantly better or worse at anything than 13 except it strongly falls behind in sucess rate when spawned far.
