Starting with phermone map 27 from run 2

Seems like it makes a map that works but only if we keep the frameskip at 30 and we get the spawn thats close to the armor, maybe try again from where we left off but lower pheremone evaporation rate? I also want to do something to discourage doomguy from walking into walls.
