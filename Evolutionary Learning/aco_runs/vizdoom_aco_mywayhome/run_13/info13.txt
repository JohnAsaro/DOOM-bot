Same as run 12 except the logic that determines what happens when every avaliable move has been already taken (so each move that the doomguy can take at a given step is part of the path).
Right now it picks randomly weighted by alpha and beta, like doomguy hasnt been to any of the possible moves before, but I am worried that might be causing pheremone clumps (albeit less exrteme ones than we saw before),
so this run just has it pick a random move in that scenerio. This also adds some good variety which might eventually optimize its self in an evolutionary fashion.

RESULT: The random logic seems to outperform the original logic in close spawns and far spawns, but in relatively close spawns, the original logic outeperforms.

Original: 
Total spawned far: 22/352 -> 6.25%
Total spawned relatively close: 46/416 -> 11.0576923077%
Total spawned close: 85/1232 -> 6.89935064935%

Random: 
Total spawned far: 25/336 -> 7.44047619048%
Total spawned relatively close: 33/389 -> 8.48329048843%
Total spawned close: 121/1275 -> 9.49019607843%

This could be due to random chance so I am going to regenrate the results to make sure.
