Same thing as last time but now we can move in any direction -> 1m steps doesnt work...again

Model developed an interesting strategy where it waited in place to get hit, and ran away when it started taking damage, and almost never shot.

(After looking back at this I might have cut it off too early, I also might have just stopped at a dead end I am not sure)
