Gonna try and redo 8 because I have a sneaking suspicion I messed it up (like I did it right the first time, checked the wrong model, and overwrote my good model), if it ends up spitting out something kind of useable, I will use that as a base for reward shaping

Result -> YO THIS WORKS, YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
