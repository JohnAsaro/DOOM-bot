env = mywayhome_VZG(config_path=doomfinder("my_way_home_4_dir.cfg"), pheromone_evaporation_rate=0.00003968253, render=False, frameskip=12) #Lower frameskip makes better maps but takes longer
aco_training(env, num_ants = 10, iterations=200, pheromone_deposit = 8.0, run_dir=run_dir, log_dir=log_dir, maps_dir=maps_dir, alpha = 0.7, beta = 0.3) #Run ACO training

Same as run 15 except frameskip of 2. Just seeing what happens.

RESULT:

Didnt finish but comparing total spawn counts at 146/200:

Total spawn counts and success rates at iteration 146/200
Total spawned far: 5/286
Total spawned relatively close: 8/293
Total spawned close: 44/891

to run 146/200 for run 13, we see it is underpreforming.

Total spawn counts and success rates at iteration 146/200
Total spawned far: 22/243
Total spawned relatively close: 25/287
Total spawned close: 84/940

Maybe it needed more steps? Maybe it would have done better if was given longer to run, idk... (see info15)
