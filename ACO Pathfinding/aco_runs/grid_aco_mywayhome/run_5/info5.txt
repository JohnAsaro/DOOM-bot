Starting fresh, now weight the final pathway in sucessful runs to account for distance spawned from goal and time it took to reach goal. 
Now hardcode all walls to already be set to -1, so hopefully it will run into walls less. 0.00009523809 = 1/2100*5, so 5 tics to evaporate a pheremone square with value 1.0.

Results -> Okay so it still kept on getting caught on walls. I think the frameskip was too high if you choose to make an action for 30 frames, 
you will just making that same action over and over again. I think I have a solution, lower the frameskip, maybe to 2 this time,
because thats still a lot of control.

I might have to hardcode the places around the walls to have 0 pheremone, so if we end up walking into the wall for a few frames, that doesnt just add up and leave tons of pheremones there.
Also, I am running this on a single computer right now and don't have multiple machines to train it, so I might just not have the processing power to train good models with low frameskips,
further necessitating hardcoding the places around the walls staying at 0 pheremones.
