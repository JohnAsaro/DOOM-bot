We go way up to a frameskip of 45, its pretty clear that high frameskips lead to easier traversal,
as we move more distance per action, but visual systems cant learn that well when using such a high frameskip,
so we need to devise a way to have it work at a lower frameskip aswell. Regardless the results are significantly better 
due to the high frameskip.

Another contributing factor could be some of the changes I made for this run, one of those being 
now cells that are adjacent to walls do not gain pheremones. I don't like this because it is super contrived,
but I just wanted to try it. I am not sure how much it helped, I should probably redo this same test without that modification.

Another thing that changed is that we consider things with a phermone value of 0. This is because due to the high frameskip
we will probably be running into things adjacent to walls a lot, and we should consider those options. I think I am ghoing to leave 
it like this. 

Also I changed phermone deposit from 8.0 to 200.0, this was the whole reason for the "next to wall = no pheremones" change because 
it was causing massive pheremone deposits to build up on walls. I am really not sure how much this helped, because the predictions
are still way off due to physics mumbo jumbo so I don't know how well it follows phermeone maps anyway. Furthermore since the actions 
are repeating for 45 frames, so it can't really follow a path if a nice one was made. 

Also also I changed the unsucessful_deposit rate to 0 which didint really meatter due to high phereomone deposit, but ill bring it back up to
0.1 in the future, unless I see reason not too.

Finally I improved the success logging for real this time so it saves every 20 iterations. This will act as a failsafe when the kernal crashes.
