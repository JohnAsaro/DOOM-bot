Same as run 12 except frameskip of 1.
Theoretically this should be good, because it can very accurately predict each step, but it was also take a long time to generate.

So the last run that logged was 58/200, which HORIFICALLY underperformed compared to 58/200 on run 13.

run 15:
Total spawn counts and success rates at iteration 58/200
Total spawned far: 0/108
Total spawned relatively close: 0/129
Total spawned close: 4/353

run 13:
Total spawn counts and success rates at iteration 58/200
Total spawned far: 11/96
Total spawned relatively close: 10/119
Total spawned close: 34/375

it also underperforms compared to run 16:
Total spawn counts and success rates at iteration 58/200
Total spawned far: 2/116
Total spawned relatively close: 2/110
Total spawned close: 16/364

Stream of consciousness: 

its possible run 15 got better overtime, but I think it just needed more tics? The fact that higher frameskips seem 
to lead to sucess more either means I just need to run these for longer, or the fact that its traveling for longer distances
on higher frameskips is randomly leading it to following the goal. I am not sure what to do right now, I have some notes in notes.txt,
but I think I am just going to work on the CMA-ES protion for now.

ACTUALLY wait I just tested some of the maps for both run 15 and run 16, test of 5 runs, 

Run 15 - Grid 110: (frameskip = 1)
Spawn counts and success ratios:
Spawned far: 1/1
Spawned relatively close: 0/1
Spawned close: 2/3

Run 16 - Grid 110: (frameskip = 2):
Spawn counts and success ratios:
Spawned far: 0/0
Spawned relatively close: 0/2
Spawned close: 2/3

Run 16 - Grid 175 (frameskip = 2):
Spawn counts and success ratios:
Spawned far: 0/0
Spawned relatively close: 0/0
Spawned close: 3/5

Run 16 - Grid 140 (frameskip = 2):
Spawn counts and success ratios:
Spawned far: 0/0
Spawned relatively close: 0/0
Spawned close: 2/5

Run 15 - Grid 110: (frameskip = 1) (done again to see if first time was a fluke):
Spawn counts and success ratios:
Spawned far: 0/1
Spawned relatively close: 0/1
Spawned close: 2/3

Run 15 - Grid 110: (frameskip = 1) (done again but change the beta calculations so that every move is considered times its adjustment (named boost) instead of 1 + its adjustment)
Spawn counts and success ratios:
Spawned far: 0/1
Spawned relatively close: 0/1
Spawned close: 2/3

Run 15 - Grid 115 (frameskip = 1):
Spawn counts and success ratios:
Spawned far: 0/2
Spawned relatively close: 0/0
Spawned close: 3/3

So I am actually going to pick up where these left off, and do another 200 generations, because it actually looks like they were going somewhere.
I am also going to do it with the adjusted beta calculation.
