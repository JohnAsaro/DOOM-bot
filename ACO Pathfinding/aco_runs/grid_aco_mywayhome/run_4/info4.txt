Starting with phermone map 27 from run 2, different from run_3 because we now reward successful paths more heavily, and pheremones go away slower.

Result -> Works similiar to run_3 but a bit better, next step is to add more things to discourage running into walls, adjust pheremone deposit so
that it is boosted for if you spawn farther away and also its boosted for completing the game in less tics.
