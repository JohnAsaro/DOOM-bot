Backlog (Ordered based on priority/how easy they are): 

Task 0 - Maybe we just eliminate the random weighted choice all together, and only make that apply when all possible options have already been in the path? 
Honestly that is probably the best way to go about this, because even if we get some paths going the wrong way, we have low phereomone deposits on those, and 
it really just needs 1 "correct" path. Also, I think this random choice is whats causing the 1 frameskip models to totally fail.

Task 1 - because the velocity and frameskip might make the steps big, 
we now might need to account for the alpha and beta in the entire path taken in a given step, 
as soon as that step hits a wall, cut it off

Task 2 - figure out how the distance from spawn to goal and time hueristic are being calculated, how much of a boost is it, 
which one is proirtized more (tbh I forgot how its calculated lol)

    Task 2.1 - do a test with varying amount of time/spawn to goal distance hueristic

Task ? - account for friction, friction is found here  (https://github.com/0dot0repeating/quakemovement) 

^ This will probably be an eternal item because this is incredibly hard to perfect, but what I have now is 
pretty good for frameskips 4 and below. It falls off the larger the frameskip gets. 

Task ?.1 - One thing I can do is 
create an updated enviornment that does everything the same but now tracks the accuracy of a given move
idk how we classify it, maybe like "hits" (exact predictions), "near misses" (almost there) and "misses" (completely off)


Possible Concessions: 

1 - a concession I could do is getting rid of the random spawn and maybe even the angle,
and then just see if the optimization works. <- If the next few tests don't work I am going to do this

2 - At risk of making the scenerio more contrived, 
I can make it so that spaces next to walls dont accumulate pheremones <- probably wont do

Tests:

1 - I could make it so that it ONLY deposits pheremones on sucessful paths -> I did this but I can do it more

Future Scenerios:
1 - E1M1 (start with no obstacles or interactables before integrating w/CMA-ES)
2 - Get 3 keys, where beta switches between keys, (so when you get one, the second part of the map gets unlocked and you can get that key, then when you get the last one the exit opens and beta switches to that)
