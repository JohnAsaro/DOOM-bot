# DOOM-bot
Making a bot play DOOM with ViZDoom and evolutionary computation (and some reinforcement learning on the older models). 

For all models to properly run, you must place DOOM.WAD, DOOM2.WAD and freedoom2.wad in the 'Games' folder.
DOOM.wad and DOOM2.wad can be purchased on Steam or GOG, and freedoom2.wad can be found here: https://freedoom.github.io/download.html
