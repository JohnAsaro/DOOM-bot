Same thing as last time but now we can move in any direction for 1m steps

Model developed an interesting strategy where it would circle strafe around the entire map until time ran out, avoiding losing score from shooting or loosing health. 
In my tests it looks like it almost never shot or lost health. This beats 1 in terms of episode length mean by a longshot.
