Picking up where 12 left off but now punishing the bot for each shot by taking away 0.01 pts and doubling movement reward

Result -> It does really good, I am happy with this model. It also heavily beats 15 in terms of length mean so that shows doubling the movement reward was the right call. 
Length mean maxes out at 925K steps for some reason.
